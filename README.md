# si-printer-bridge

si-printer-bridge is a simple system that aims to reduce complexity and hassle when
using the [SPORTident](https://www.sportident.com/) timing system during 
orienteering practice sessions.

si-printer-bridge allows a reader station to be connected directly to a thermal 
printer without the use of an android phone with bluetooth or similar. The 
entire system may be powered using a conventional USB power bank.
